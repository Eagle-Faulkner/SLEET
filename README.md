# SLEET
Simple Lightweight Emulator Executable Tool(SLEET) was created for emulation on computers to help users put together a nicer way of viewing their games, whether that's through a folder on their desktop, an external program, or even Steam.

## Installation

To install SLEET on a windows computer simply download a release zip and unpack it to whatever directory you prefer(Likely Program Files).  Make sure file and folder hierarchy remain unchanged.

## Usage

To Create a Windows executable file
    1)Launch SLEET.exe
    2)Make sure you're on the Basic tab
    3)Select your emulator of choice from the drop-down menu
    4)Provide the location of the emulator's .exe(This should be a prompt when you choose your emulator from the drop down for the first time)
    5)Provide the location of the rom(the game you plan to launch with the emulator)
    6)Provide the location of the folder you wish to save the executable to
    7)Provide the name you want the executable to have
    8)Optionally provide a unique icon for the executable(must be in .ico format)
    9)Click the "Create .EXE" button
